title: Automatic Robotic Grocery Shelving System
description:  Designed and prototyped an automated stocking system to improve accessibility in grocery stores. The gantry based device detects low inventory, retrieves cartons from storage, and restocks shelves while ensuring items roll forward for customer reach. Integrated CAD design, FEA, FMEA, and "design for manufacture" principles guided development of a safe, low cost prototype that reduces employee workload and prevents products from getting stuck at the back of refrigerated shelves.
